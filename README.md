# HandBent-Case
Sheet metal synth case made from 2mm thick aluminum which can be bent and assembled by hand.
Holes can and should be adapted depending on PSU and rails you intend to use.

IMPORTANT:
The rails used are called "GB 29 L" and are made by Fischer. They can be sourced from different resellers depending on your region.

The cold appliance socket was from a now deactivated Amazon link. You could adapt that as well or measure and get a fitting socket. Make sure it has a housing for a fuse.

MORE IMPORTANT:
This is a metallic case and electricity loves to go through it and your unsuspecting hearts and brains. Please use a chassis ground and common sense.

Hope you have fun building it, it's cheaper than most cases you can buy.
Cheers!
